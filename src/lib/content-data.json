We cover routing, components, and state management.\n\n## What is SvelteKit?\n\nSvelteKit is a framework for building extremely high-performance web apps. It's built on top of Svelte, which compiles your components to highly efficient vanilla JavaScript at build time.\n\n## Why SvelteKit?\n\n1. **Performance**: Svelte's compile-time approach results in smaller bundles and faster runtime\n2. **Developer Experience**: Excellent tooling and hot module replacement\n3. **Flexibility**: Works as an SPA, SSR, or static site generator\n4. **Progressive Enhancement**: Built-in support for enhanced user experiences\n\n## Getting Started\n\n1. Install Node.js (v16 or higher)\n2. Create a new project with `npm create svelte@latest my-app`\n3. Install dependencies with `npm install`\n4. Start the development server with `npm run dev`"
