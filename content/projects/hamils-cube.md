A puzzle-solving Android mobile game that combines the concept of Rubik's cube and Hamiltonian path, made in Unity.

## Description

The game challenges players to solve increasingly complex puzzles by manipulating a 3D grid system where each rotation affects multiple elements simultaneously. The core mechanic revolves around finding the most efficient sequence of moves to reach the target configuration, similar to solving a Rubik's cube but with added complexity from Hamiltonian path constraints that guide optimal solutions.
