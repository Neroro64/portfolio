Mirrorception is a demo of a platform puzzle game, where players must utilize the mirrored version of the world to solve puzzles that would be impossible in the real world. By entering reflective surfaces, players can access alternate dimensions where gravity, object interactions, and spatial relationships behave differently.

## Implementation details

This project was developed in Unity using C#, with most assets created from scratch including 3D models and animations using Blender.
The implementation features:

- Custom character controller with mirror-switching mechanics
- Seamless transition between mirrored and real worlds
- Interactive environments with reflective surfaces
- Mirror physics simulation that affects object behavior
- Puzzle design that requires understanding of mirror properties

## Tech stack

- **Game Engine**: Unity 2022.3 LTS
- **Programming Language**: C#
- **3D Modeling & Animation**: Blender
