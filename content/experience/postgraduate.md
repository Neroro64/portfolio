### About Me
**Nuo Chen, me@nuoc.dev**

I pursued my Masters at KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Sweden, focusing on computer science and machine learning.

### Exchange Program at NTU Singapore

Studied fundamentals of machine learning and probability while immersing myself in a diverse cultural environment that broadened my research perspective.

### Research Focus – Master Thesis
My thesis investigated *Procedural Animation Generation via Mixture‑of‑Experts (MoE) Networks* that can transfer learned motion patterns between character rigs when only limited target data is available.

Key contributions include:
- Design of an MoE architecture conditioned on positional and rotational objectives for generating skeletal motions.
- Integration of several transfer‑learning strategies (feature‑encoding, feature‑clustering, feature‑selection) to adapt the MoE model across diverse rig domains.
- Implementation in PyTorch Lightning with a modular training pipeline, automated hyper‑parameter tuning using Ray Tune, and reproducible experiment scripts.
- Empirical evaluation on multiple datasets showing significant improvements over baseline MLP/LSTM baselines in both quantitative metrics (reconstruction error) and qualitative animation quality.
