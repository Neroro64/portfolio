In this article, I walk through the basics of SvelteKit and how to get started building modern web applications. We cover routing, components, and state management.

## What is SvelteKit?

SvelteKit is a framework for building extremely high-performance web apps. It's built on top of Svelte, which compiles your components to highly efficient vanilla JavaScript at build time.

## Why SvelteKit?

1. **Performance**: Svelte's compile-time approach results in smaller bundles and faster runtime
2. **Developer Experience**: Excellent tooling and hot module replacement
3. **Flexibility**: Works as an SPA, SSR, or static site generator
4. **Progressive Enhancement**: Built-in support for enhanced user experiences

## Getting Started

1. Install Node.js (v16 or higher)
2. Create a new project with `npm create svelte@latest my-app`
3. Install dependencies with `npm install`
4. Start the development server with `npm run dev`
