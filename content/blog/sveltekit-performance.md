Performance optimization is crucial for modern web applications. Here are some techniques I've found effective for SvelteKit applications.

## Bundle Optimization

### Code Splitting

Use SvelteKit's built-in code splitting to load only the necessary JavaScript for each page.

### Tree Shaking

Ensure unused code is removed during the build process by using proper import syntax.

## Data Loading Strategies

### Server-Side Rendering (SSR)

For content-heavy pages, use SSR to improve initial load times and SEO.

### Client-Side Rendering (CSR)

For interactive applications, CSR can provide better user experience after initial load.

## Caching Techniques

### HTTP Caching

Implement appropriate cache headers for static assets and API responses.

### Service Workers

Use service workers for offline capabilities and faster subsequent loads.
