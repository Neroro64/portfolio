In this article, I share my insights on TypeScript best practices that have proven effective in modern web development.

## Key Concepts

### Type Safety First

Always prefer explicit typing over type inference when it improves readability and maintainability.

### Use Utility Types

Leverage built-in utility types like `Partial<T>`, `Pick<T, K>`, and `Omit<T, K>` to create more reusable code.

### Strict Mode

Enable strict mode in your tsconfig.json for better type checking and fewer runtime errors.

## Advanced Patterns

### Discriminated Unions

Use discriminated unions for handling different types of events or actions in a type-safe way.

### Conditional Types

Leverage conditional types for creating generic utilities that adapt based on input types.

### Mapped Types

Create new types by transforming existing ones using mapped types for more flexible code.
